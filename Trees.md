# Trees 

#### A tree data structure can be defined recursively as a collection of nodes (starting at a root node), where each node is a data structure consisting of a value, together with a list of references to nodes (the "children"), with the constraints that no reference is duplicated, and none points to the root.

## Node

#### A node is the individual item/data that makes up the data structureS

## Root

#### The root is the first/top Node in the tree

## Left child

#### The node that is positioned to the left of a root or node

## Right child

#### The node that is positioned to the right of a root or node

## Edge

#### The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node

## Leaf

#### A leaf is a node that does not contain any children

## Height

#### The height of a tree is determined by the number of edges from the root to the bottommost node

## Depth First

### Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first. There are multiple ways to carry out depth first traversal, and each method changes the order in which we search/print the root.

## Breadth First

### Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node.

## Binary Trees

### In all of our examples, weâ€™ve been using a Binary Tree. Trees can have any number of children per node, but Binary Trees restrict the number of children to two (hence our left and right children).
