#### Hooks must be named with a use prefix (i.e. useFishingPole)Only call Hooks at the top level. Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.Only call Hooks from React function components. Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. (There is just one other valid place to call Hooks — your own custom Hooks. We’ll learn about them in a moment.)
