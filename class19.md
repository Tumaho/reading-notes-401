## Message Queuing:

### Message queue provides an asynchronous communications protocol,which is a system that puts a message onto a message queue and does not require an immediate response to continuing processing.

## Message queuing:

### allows applications to communicate by sending messages to each other. The message queue provides temporary message storage when the destination program is busy or not connected. 

## Message: 

### the message is the data transported between the sender and the receiver application;it's essentially a byte array with some headers at the top.

## the queue: 

### is a line of things waiting to be handled,starting at the beginning of the line and processing it in sequential order.

## event:

### is What event has happened during transporting data (delete, add, update or connection lost ...etc)

## The payload :

### is the data associated with the event.

## Namespace:
### It is a declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers (the names of types, functions, variables, etc) inside it.

### Namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups and to prevent name collisions that can occur especially when your codebase includes multiple libraries.

## Default namespace

### We call the default namespace / and itâ€™s the one Socket.IO clients connect to by default, and the one the server listens to by default.
